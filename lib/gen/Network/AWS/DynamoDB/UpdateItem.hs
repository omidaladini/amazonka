-- | Edits an existing item's attributes, or inserts a new item if it does not
-- already exist. You can put, delete, or add attribute values. You can also
-- perform a conditional update (insert a new attribute name-value pair if it
-- doesn't exist, or replace an existing name-value pair if it has certain
-- expected attribute values). In addition to updating an item, you can also
-- return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the
-- ReturnValues parameter. Conditional Update This example updates the Thread
-- table, changing the LastPostedBy attribute-but only if LastPostedBy is
-- currently "fred@example.com". All of the item's attributes, as they appear
-- after the update, are returned in the response. { }.

      -- ^ The names of attributes to be modified, the action to perform on each, and
      -- the new value for each. If you are updating an attribute that is an index
      -- key attribute for any indexes on that table, the attribute type must match
      -- the index key type defined in the AttributesDefinition of the table
      -- description. You can use UpdateItem to update any non-key attributes.
      -- Attribute values cannot be null. String and binary type attributes must
      -- have lengths greater than zero. Set type attributes must not be empty.
      -- Requests with empty values will be rejected with a ValidationException.
      -- Each AttributeUpdates element consists of an attribute name to modify,
      -- along with the following: Value - The new value, if applicable, for this
      -- attribute. Action - Specifies how to perform the update. Valid values for
      -- Action are PUT, DELETE, and ADD. The behavior depends on whether the
      -- specified primary key already exists in the table. If an item with the
      -- specified Key is found in the table: PUT - Adds the specified attribute to
      -- the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value.
      -- DELETE - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed
      -- from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing
      -- value's data type. If a set of values is specified, then those values are
      -- subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the
      -- set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specified [a,c], then the final attribute
      -- value would be [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error. ADD - If the
      -- attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are
      -- added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD
      -- depends on the data type of the attribute: If the existing attribute is a
      -- number, and if Value is also a number, then the Value is mathematically
      -- added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is
      -- subtracted from the existing attribute. If you use ADD to increment or
      -- decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update,
      -- Amazon DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. In addition, if you use ADD to
      -- update an existing item, and intend to increment or decrement an attribute
      -- value which does not yet exist, Amazon DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial
      -- value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet
      -- have an attribute named itemcount, but you decide to ADD the number 3 to
      -- this attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. Amazon
      -- DynamoDB will create the itemcount attribute, set its initial value to 0,
      -- and finally add 3 to it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute in
      -- the item, with a value of 3. If the existing data type is a set, and if the
      -- Value is also a set, then the Value is added to the existing set. (This is
      -- a set operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the attribute
      -- value was the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final
      -- attribute value would be [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an Add action is
      -- specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not
      -- match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data
      -- type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value
      -- must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and
      -- binary sets. This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data
      -- type is number or is a set. Do not use ADD for any other data types. If no
      -- item with the specified Key is found: PUT - Amazon DynamoDB creates a new
      -- item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute. DELETE -
      -- Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete. ADD - Amazon DynamoDB
      -- creates an item with the supplied primary key and number (or set of
      -- numbers) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed are number
      -- and number set; no other data types can be specified. If you specify any
      -- attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those
      -- attributes must match those of the schema in the table's attribute
      -- definition.
    , uiiExpected :: HashMap Text ExpectedAttributeValue
      -- ^ A map of attribute/condition pairs. This is the conditional block for the
      -- UpdateItem operation. All the conditions must be met for the operation to
      -- succeed. Expected allows you to provide an attribute name, and whether or
      -- not Amazon DynamoDB should check to see if the attribute value already
      -- exists; or if the attribute value exists and has a particular value before
      -- changing it. Each item in Expected represents an attribute name for Amazon
      -- DynamoDB to check, along with the following: Value - The attribute value
      -- for Amazon DynamoDB to check. Exists - Causes Amazon DynamoDB to evaluate
      -- the value before attempting a conditional operation: If Exists is true,
      -- Amazon DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in
      -- the table. If it is found, then the operation succeeds. If it is not found,
      -- the operation fails with a ConditionalCheckFailedException. If Exists is
      -- false, Amazon DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in
      -- the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is
      -- valid and the operation succeeds. If the value is found, despite the
      -- assumption that it does not exist, the operation fails with a
      -- ConditionalCheckFailedException. The default setting for Exists is true. If
      -- you supply a Value all by itself, Amazon DynamoDB assumes the attribute
      -- exists: You don't have to set Exists to true, because it is implied. Amazon
      -- DynamoDB returns a ValidationException if: Exists is true but there is no
      -- Value to check. (You expect a value to exist, but don't specify what that
      -- value is.) Exists is false but you also specify a Value. (You cannot expect
      -- an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not to exist.) If you
      -- specify more than one condition for Exists, then all of the conditions must
      -- evaluate to true. (In other words, the conditions are ANDed together.)
      -- Otherwise, the conditional operation will fail.

      -- nothing is returned. (This is the default for ReturnValues.) ALL_OLD - If
      -- UpdateItem overwrote an attribute name-value pair, then the content of the
      -- old item is returned. UPDATED_OLD - The old versions of only the updated
