-- | The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by
-- accessing every item in the table. To have Amazon DynamoDB return fewer
-- items, you can provide a ScanFilter. If the total number of scanned items
-- exceeds the maximum data set size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results
-- are returned to the user with a LastEvaluatedKey to continue the scan in a
-- subsequent operation. The results also include the number of items
-- exceeding the limit. A scan can result in no table data meeting the filter
-- criteria. The result set is eventually consistent. By default, Scan
-- operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on large
-- tables, applications can request a parallel Scan by specifying the Segment
-- and TotalSegments parameters. For more information, see Parallel Scan in
-- the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. Returning All Items This example
-- returns all of the items in a table. No scan filter is applied. {

      -- ^ The primary key of the first item that this operation will evalute. Use the

      -- the response.
    , siScanFilter :: HashMap Text Condition
      -- ^ Evaluates the scan results and returns only the desired values. Multiple
      -- conditions are treated as "AND" operations: all conditions must be met to
      -- be included in the results. Each ScanConditions element consists of an
      -- attribute name to compare, along with the following: AttributeValueList -
      -- One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. This list
      -- contains exactly one value, except for a BETWEEN or IN comparison, in which
      -- case the list contains two values. For type Number, value comparisons are
      -- numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than
      -- are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a is greater than A,
      -- and aa is greater than B. For a list of code values, see
      -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters. For Binary,
      -- Amazon DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it
      -- compares binary values, for example when evaluating query expressions.
      -- ComparisonOperator - A comparator for evaluating attributes. For example,
      -- equals, greater than, less than, etc. Valid comparison operators for Scan:
      -- EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS |
      -- BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN For information on specifying data types in
      -- JSON, see JSON Data Format in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. The
      -- following are descriptions of each comparison operator. EQ : Equal.
      -- AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String,
      -- Number, or Binary (not a set). If an item contains an AttributeValue of a
      -- different type than the one specified in the request, the value does not
      -- match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"}
      -- does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}. NE : Not equal. AttributeValueList
      -- can contain only one AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not
      -- a set). If an item contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the
      -- one specified in the request, the value does not match. For example,
      -- {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not equal
      -- {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}. LE : Less than or equal. AttributeValueList can
      -- contain only one AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a
      -- set). If an item contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the
      -- one specified in the request, the value does not match. For example,
      -- {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to
      -- {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}. LT : Less than. AttributeValueList can contain only
      -- one AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If an
      -- item contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the one specified
      -- in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not
      -- equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2",
      -- "1"]}. GE : Greater than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one
      -- AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If an item
      -- contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the one specified in
      -- the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not
      -- equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2",
      -- "1"]}. GT : Greater than. AttributeValueList can contain only one
      -- AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If an item
      -- contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the one specified in
      -- the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not
      -- equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2",
      -- "1"]}. NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NULL : The attribute does not
      -- exist. CONTAINS : checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.
      -- AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String,
      -- Number, or Binary (not a set). If the target attribute of the comparison is
      -- a String, then the operation checks for a substring match. If the target
      -- attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operation looks for a
      -- subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute
      -- of the comparison is a set ("SS", "NS", or "BS"), then the operation checks
      -- for a member of the set (not as a substring). NOT_CONTAINS : checks for
      -- absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.
      -- AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String,
      -- Number, or Binary (not a set). If the target attribute of the comparison is
      -- a String, then the operation checks for the absence of a substring match.
      -- If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operation
      -- checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the
      -- input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("SS", "NS", or
      -- "BS"), then the operation checks for the absence of a member of the set
      -- (not as a substring). BEGINS_WITH : checks for a prefix. AttributeValueList
      -- can contain only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number
      -- or a set). The target attribute of the comparison must be a String or
      -- Binary (not a Number or a set). IN : checks for exact matches.
      -- AttributeValueList can contain more than one AttributeValue of type String,
      -- Number, or Binary (not a set). The target attribute of the comparison must
      -- be of the same type and exact value to match. A String never matches a
      -- String set. BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less
      -- than or equal to the second value. AttributeValueList must contain two
      -- AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary
      -- (not a set). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater
      -- than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second
      -- element. If an item contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the
      -- one specified in the request, the value does not match. For example,
      -- {"S":"6"} does not compare to {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare
      -- to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.
    , siSegment :: Maybe Int
      -- ^ For a parallel Scan request, Segment identifies an individual segment to be
      -- scanned by an application worker. Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first
      -- segment is always 0. For example, if you want to scan a table using four
      -- application threads, the first thread would specify a Segment value of 0,
      -- the second thread would specify 1, and so on. The value of LastEvaluatedKey
      -- returned from a parallel Scan request must be used as ExclusiveStartKey
      -- with the same Segment ID in a subsequent Scan operation. The value for
      -- Segment must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than the value
      -- provided for TotalSegments. If you specify Segment, you must also specify
      -- TotalSegments.
    , siSelect :: Maybe Select
      -- ^ The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item
      -- attributes, specific item attributes, or the count of matching items.
      -- ALL_ATTRIBUTES: Returns all of the item attributes. COUNT: Returns the
      -- number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves.
      -- SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES : Returns only the attributes listed in
      -- AttributesToGet. This is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without
      -- specifying any value for Select. If neither Select nor AttributesToGet are
      -- specified, Amazon DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES. You cannot use both
      -- Select and AttributesToGet together in a single request, unless the value
      -- for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying
      -- AttributesToGet without any value for Select.).
    , siTableName :: !Text
      -- ^ The name of the table containing the requested items.
    , siTotalSegments :: Maybe Int
      -- ^ For a parallel Scan request, TotalSegments represents the total number of
      -- segments into which the Scan operation will be divided. The value of
      -- TotalSegments corresponds to the number of application workers that will
      -- perform the parallel scan. For example, if you want to scan a table using
      -- four application threads, you would specify a TotalSegments value of 4. The
      -- value for TotalSegments must be greater than or equal to 1, and less than
      -- or equal to 4096. If you specify a TotalSegments value of 1, the Scan will
      -- be sequential rather than parallel. If you specify TotalSegments, you must
      -- also specify Segment.
