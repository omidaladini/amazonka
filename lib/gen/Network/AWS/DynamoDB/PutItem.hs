-- | Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item
-- already exists in the specified table with the same primary key, the new
-- item completely replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional
-- put (insert a new item if one with the specified primary key doesn't
-- exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values. In
-- addition to putting an item, you can also return the item's attribute
-- values in the same operation, using the ReturnValues parameter. When you
-- add an item, the primary key attribute(s) are the only required attributes.
-- Attribute values cannot be null. String and binary type attributes must
-- have lengths greater than zero. Set type attributes cannot be empty.
-- Requests with empty values will be rejected with a ValidationException. You
-- can request that PutItem return either a copy of the old item (before the
-- update) or a copy of the new item (after the update). For more information,
-- see the ReturnValues description. To prevent a new item from replacing an
-- existing item, use a conditional put operation with Exists set to false for
-- the primary key attribute, or attributes. For more information about using
-- this API, see Working with Items in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
-- Put an Item This example puts a new item into the Thread table. To prevent
-- this new item from overwriting an existing item, "Exists" is set to false
-- for the primary key attributes. { }.

      -- ^ A map of attribute/condition pairs. This is the conditional block for the
      -- PutItem operation. All the conditions must be met for the operation to
      -- succeed. Expected allows you to provide an attribute name, and whether or
      -- not Amazon DynamoDB should check to see if the attribute value already
      -- exists; or if the attribute value exists and has a particular value before
      -- changing it. Each item in Expected represents an attribute name for Amazon
      -- DynamoDB to check, along with the following: Value - The attribute value
      -- for Amazon DynamoDB to check. Exists - Causes Amazon DynamoDB to evaluate
      -- the value before attempting a conditional operation: If Exists is true,
      -- Amazon DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in
      -- the table. If it is found, then the operation succeeds. If it is not found,
      -- the operation fails with a ConditionalCheckFailedException. If Exists is
      -- false, Amazon DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in
      -- the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is
      -- valid and the operation succeeds. If the value is found, despite the
      -- assumption that it does not exist, the operation fails with a
      -- ConditionalCheckFailedException. The default setting for Exists is true. If
      -- you supply a Value all by itself, Amazon DynamoDB assumes the attribute
      -- exists: You don't have to set Exists to true, because it is implied. Amazon
      -- DynamoDB returns a ValidationException if: Exists is true but there is no
      -- Value to check. (You expect a value to exist, but don't specify what that
      -- value is.) Exists is false but you also specify a Value. (You cannot expect
      -- an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not to exist.) If you
      -- specify more than one condition for Exists, then all of the conditions must
      -- evaluate to true. (In other words, the conditions are ANDed together.)
      -- Otherwise, the conditional operation will fail.

      -- primary key attributes are required; you can optionally provide other

      -- are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must
      -- match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition. For more
      -- information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the Amazon DynamoDB
      -- Developer Guide. Each element in the Item map is an AttributeValue object.

      -- the response.

      -- ^ If set to SIZE, statistics about item collections, if any, that were
      -- modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to NONE

      -- before they were updated with the PutItem request. For PutItem, the valid
      -- values are: NONE - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is
      -- NONE, then nothing is returned. (This is the default for ReturnValues.)
