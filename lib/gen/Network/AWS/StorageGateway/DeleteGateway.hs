-- | This operation deletes a gateway. To specify which gateway to delete, use
-- the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request. The
-- operation deletes the gateway; however, it does not delete the gateway
-- virtual machine (VM) from your host computer. After you delete a gateway,
-- you cannot reactivate it. Completed snapshots of the gateway volumes are
-- not deleted upon deleting the gateway, however, pending snapshots will not
-- complete. After you delete a gateway, your next step is to remove it from
-- your environment. You no longer pay software charges after the gateway is
-- deleted; however, your existing Amazon EBS snapshots persist and you will
-- continue to be billed for these snapshots. You can choose to remove all
-- remaining Amazon EBS snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2 subscription.
-- If you prefer not to cancel your Amazon EC2 subscription, you can delete
-- your snapshots using the Amazon EC2 console. For more information, see the
-- AWS Storage Gateway Detail Page. Example Request The following example
-- shows a request that deactivates a gateway. POST / HTTP/1.1 Host:
