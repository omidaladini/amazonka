-- | This operation returns information about the working storage of a gateway.
-- This operation is supported only for the gateway-stored volume
-- architecture. Working storage is also referred to as upload buffer. You can
-- also use the DescribeUploadBuffer operation to add upload buffer to a
-- stored-volume gateway. The response includes disk IDs that are configured
-- as working storage, and it includes the amount of working storage allocated
-- and used. Example Request The following example shows a request to obtain a
-- description of a gateway's working storage. POST / HTTP/1.1 Host:
