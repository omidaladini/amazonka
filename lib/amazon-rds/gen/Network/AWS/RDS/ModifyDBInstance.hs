      -- storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if
      -- any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration
      -- times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in
      -- some cases. During the migration, the DB instance will be available for

      -- RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the
      -- instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read
      -- replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

      -- ^ Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter
      -- does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as
      -- soon as possible. Constraints: This parameter must be set to true when
      -- specifying a value for the EngineVersion parameter that is a different
      -- major version than the DB instance's current version.

      -- ^ Specifies whether or not the modifications in this request and any pending
      -- modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of
      -- the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the DB instance. If this
      -- parameter is passed as false, changes to the DB instance are applied on the
      -- next call to RebootDBInstance, the next maintenance reboot, or the next
      -- failure reboot, whichever occurs first. See each parameter to determine
      -- when a change is applied. Default: false.
    , mdbimAutoMinorVersionUpgrade :: Maybe Bool
      -- ^ Indicates that minor version upgrades will be applied automatically to the
      -- DB instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parameter does not
      -- result in an outage except in the following case and the change is
      -- asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An outage will result if this
      -- parameter is set to true during the maintenance window, and a newer minor
      -- version is available, and RDS has enabled auto patching for that engine
      -- version.
    , mdbimBackupRetentionPeriod :: Maybe Int
      -- ^ The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a
      -- positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables
      -- automated backups. Changing this parameter can result in an outage if you
      -- change from 0 to a non-zero value or from a non-zero value to 0. These
      -- changes are applied during the next maintenance window unless the
      -- ApplyImmediately parameter is set to true for this request. If you change
      -- the parameter from one non-zero value to another non-zero value, the change
      -- is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Default: Uses existing
      -- setting Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35 Can be specified for a
      -- read replica only if the source is running MySQL 5.6 Cannot be set to 0 if
      -- the DB instance is a source to read replicas.
    , mdbimDBInstanceClass :: Maybe Text
      -- ^ The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance. To determine the
      -- instance classes that are available for a particular DB engine, use the
      -- DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions action. Passing a value for this
      -- parameter causes an outage during the change and is applied during the next
      -- maintenance window, unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is specified as
      -- true for this request. Default: Uses existing setting Valid Values:

      -- must be a letter Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive
      -- hyphens.
    , mdbimDBParameterGroupName :: Maybe Text
      -- ^ The name of the DB parameter group to apply to this DB instance. Changing
      -- this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is applied
      -- during the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is
      -- set to true for this request. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints:
      -- The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter group family as
      -- this DB instance.
    , mdbimDBSecurityGroups :: [Text]
      -- ^ A list of DB security groups to authorize on this DB instance. Changing
      -- this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is
      -- asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Constraints: Must be 1 to 255
      -- alphanumeric characters First character must be a letter Cannot end with a
      -- hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
    , mdbimEngineVersion :: Maybe Text
      -- ^ The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this
      -- parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next
      -- maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is set to true for
      -- this request. For major version upgrades, if a non-default DB parameter
      -- group is currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter
      -- group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB
      -- parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family.
      -- Example: 5.1.42.
    , mdbimIops :: Maybe Int
      -- ^ The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS
      -- instance. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the
      -- change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the
      -- ApplyImmediately parameter is set to true for this request. Default: Uses
      -- existing setting Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater
      -- than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the
      -- existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current
      -- value. Type: Integer If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using
      -- standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS
      -- to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the
      -- migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size,

      -- replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.
    , mdbimMasterUserPassword :: Maybe Text
      -- ^ The new password for the DB instance master user. Can be any printable
      -- ASCII character except "/", """, or "@". Changing this parameter does not
      -- result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as
      -- possible. Between the time of the request and the completion of the
      -- request, the MasterUserPassword element exists in the PendingModifiedValues
      -- element of the operation response. Default: Uses existing setting
      -- Constraints: Must be 8 to 41 alphanumeric characters (MySQL), 8 to 30
      -- alphanumeric characters (Oracle), or 8 to 128 alphanumeric characters (SQL
      -- Server). Amazon RDS API actions never return the password, so this action
      -- provides a way to regain access to a master instance user if the password
      -- is lost.
    , mdbimMultiAZ :: Maybe Bool
      -- ^ Specifies if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing this
      -- parameter does not result in an outage and the change is applied during the
      -- next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is set to
      -- true for this request. Constraints: Cannot be specified if the DB instance
      -- is a read replica.
    , mdbimNewDBInstanceIdentifier :: Maybe Text
      -- ^ The new DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB
      -- Instance. This value is stored as a lowercase string. Constraints: Must
      -- contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens First character
      -- must be a letter Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive
      -- hyphens.
    , mdbimOptionGroupName :: Maybe Text
      -- ^ Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified
      -- option group. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage except
      -- in the following case and the change is applied during the next maintenance
      -- window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is set to true for this
      -- request. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables
      -- OEM, this change can cause a brief (sub-second) period during which new
      -- connections are rejected but existing connections are not interrupted.
      -- cannot be removed from an option group while DB instances are associated
      -- with the option group. --> Permanent options, such as the TDE option for
      -- Oracle Advanced Security TDE, cannot be removed from an option group, and
      -- that option group cannot be removed from a DB instance once it is
      -- associated with a DB instance.
    , mdbimPreferredBackupWindow :: Maybe Text
      -- ^ The daily time range during which automated backups are created if
      -- automated backups are enabled, as determined by the BackupRetentionPeriod.
      -- Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is
      -- asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Constraints: Must be in the
      -- format hh24:mi-hh24:mi Times should be Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)

      -- minutes.
    , mdbimPreferredMaintenanceWindow :: Maybe Text
      -- ^ The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur,
      -- which may result in an outage. Changing this parameter does not result in
      -- an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is
      -- asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions
      -- that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the
      -- current time, then changing this parameter will cause a reboot of the DB
      -- instance. If moving this window to the current time, there must be at least
      -- 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending
      -- changes are applied. Default: Uses existing setting Format:
      -- ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun
      -- Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes.
